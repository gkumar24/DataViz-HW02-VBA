# Home Work Assignment - The VBA of Wall Street

## Assignment Scope

* Analyzing Stock data for the years 2014, 2015 and 2016. provided in an excel file, with each year in an worksheet.

* Here I used VBA to parse through each of the worksheet, and solved the following.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  
  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  
  * The total stock volume of the stock.
  
  * You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
  
  * Return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
  
  * Code that will loop through each of the years (worksheet)
