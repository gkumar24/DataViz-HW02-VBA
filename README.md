  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  
  * The total stock volume of the stock.
  
  * You should also have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
  
  * Return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
